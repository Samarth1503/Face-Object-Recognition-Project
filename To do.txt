app.py:
when it redirects to any other script, terminate 'app.py'


1) Create a global dictionary variable called 'recognized_face' and save the recognised face's name and coordinates for the square in it.
2) Whenever the a face is recognised, update 'recognized_face' with the new face's data in it. Use 'recognized_face' variable to show the name of the recognised person and the coordinates of the square.
If there are multiple different faces recognised then use the name as the key.

1) The recognition square keeps blinking, to prevent this from happening, until a new face is recognised, use the same 'recognized_face' for the square. Create a global variable called 'recognised_face_colour' to store the rgb colour for the square

save the 'known_encodings[]' from the load_known_faces() in a '.txt' file inside a folder called 'knownDatasetEncodings' and use this file to retrive the 'known_encodings[]'. Extract the 'load_known_faces()' to be added to a new script called 'Processing_faces' which will have two functions called: 'load_known_faces()' and 'process_new_faces()'. 'process_new_faces()' will update the 'known_encodings[]'  and 'load_known_faces()' will retrive the 'known_encodings[]'

I merged 'load_known_faces()' & 'process_new_faces()' with 'face_recognition_script.py' & 'face_registration_script.py'.
Is it possible to load the cam in the app.py file and send it to 'face_recognition_script.py' & 'face_registration_script.py' so it reduces the time taken for the camera to load.


The following is my script for app.py, but I have a problem where if i the pyhton app isn't visible in the taskbar, the window disappears whenever I use alt+tab. The following is the code:
